    <h2>The Beach</h2>

    <section>
      <p>We used to go the beach a lot. It was really hot in the summer time. Going in the ocean was fun. Sometimes people pulled sharks out of the water.</p>

    <h1>College Years</h1>

    <section>
      <p>I went to school in Boston. It was a grand old time. I learned about cheese steaks and they are yummy.</p>
